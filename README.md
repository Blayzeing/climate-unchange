# climate-unchange
Help *__Leta__* (no relation to any real persons living or dead), teenage climate-activist and general world-superhero, use a
time machine to go back in time and fight the
effects, and then the causes of climate change using her *__fists of fury__* - but watch out! Her time-manipulator is on
the fritz, and she's spiralling through the ages, changing timezone every thirty seconds! Can you stop the world from heating up?

_Climate Unchange_ is a game created at the Sheffield University ShefJam7 game jam in the space of 40 hours by two people. The
theme was "Climate Change" so, thinking that there would be quite a few down-beat and maybe depressing "end-of-the-world" type
entries decided to make an a more up-beat crazy hack n' slash and/or bullethell game in which a Thunbergian character takes the
fight to climate change in a very direct manner while still reminding players of at least some core environmental knowledge.

As with most games made at game jams, this was rather rushed and the end result differs from our goal quite significantly. It
is the first 2D game to test the use of the [Blayze Tech Utils](https://github.com/Blayzeing/blayzeTechUtils) tools. It may well
be the last. We were pleasantly surprised when this game won the Jam's award for "Funniest Game".

Run either by running the compile and run shell script (compileandrun.sh) or run `$ javac *.java` followed by `$ java ClimateUnchange` to compile and then run the game.
